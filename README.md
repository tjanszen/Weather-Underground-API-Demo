# Weather-Underground-API-Demo

I was recently developing a weather application using the Weather Underground API and I stumbled accross their traffic camera API. I ended up developing a second application that uses a zip code or a users geolocation to display all of the traffic cams in a particular area. I used jQuery and Javascript to parse the JSON data received back from the API call. I have kept the UI very basic for now. This tutorial will go through the steps to setup the application and get a basic MVP running. You will want a basic understanding of AJAX, Javascript, and jQuery in order to follow along. This post is geared towards junior developers getting their feet wet with API's. I will follow up this post with another one geared towards the UI/design. I hope you enjoy!
